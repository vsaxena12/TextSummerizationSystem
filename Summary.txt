
However, dealing with such a huge amount of information is not an easy task and this leads to the problem of information overloading.Thus, the project deals with extracting the useful, non-redundant information with the process of automatic text summarization.This process is repeated for each cluster and summary is generated depending on the rank of the sentence.If the use provides a positive response, images are searched from Google and the user is asked to choose one.The user is also prompted for inclusion of image in the slide.The user may also provide images from the directory.For creation and manipulation of presentations, Apache POI is used.In feature specific algorithm, the score of the sentences are generated using the concept of inverse sentence frequency.In this, a summary is generated by extracting the highly ranked sentences and extraction is done until the summary length is met.Proper noun
It is the number of proper nouns the sentence contains.Term weight
It depicts the number of occurrences of a term in a document.The term weight corresponds to the importance of the term in context with the subject under consideration.This feature is the ration of numerical data in a sentence and the length of the sentence.Having a higher score in the feature denotes higher importance of the sentence.Numerical data
Sentences having numerical data are usually necessary to be included in the summary.Higher the score of a sentence more is the importance of the sentence.This score is further incremented based on the features of title, sentence length term weight, sentence position, presence of proper noun and numerical data.TF-ISF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values are computed for each sentence-word pair.Shorter sentences are not expected to be a part of the summary.Each entry in this matrix is an integer count.The concept of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to fill the matrix to reflect the count of a particular word in a specific document.3) Score generation based on feature profile
In this step, the documents in a particular cluster are split into sentences.This is the most straightforward way of computing distances between objects in a multi-dimensional space.[4]

Document Representation

After preprocessing, we obtain a collection of words from the set of documents.To ease the work of people who deals with presentations and summaries daily like in seminars, classrooms etc.

Initially, the user has to provide the system with input documents, which can be of any file format, including .docx, .pdf, .html etc.  These files have to be first converted to text files.For this purpose, Java provides various facilities for reading, writing and creating files.There are seven steps to be covered in the design phase.However, it also allows the user to personalize the presentation in case the user wants to.Objectives
To automate the process of creating the presentation.Knowing the importance of creating a presentation, it has become important to modify it and make the system automated.However, the current system of creating a presentation technique is a complex issue.It is time consuming, tedious and effort making.Till the present situation, creating a presentation for a presenter is not an easy task.METHODOLOGY
A presentation plays an important role when it comes to represent an idea or to explain the topic to the audience.They include title feature, sentence length, term weight, sentence position, proper noun, and numerical data.Summaries should preserve the essence of the subject of its source(s).A summary should typically be short, precise and to the point.A text is entered into the computer and a summarized text is returned, which is a non-redundant extract from the original text.According to [1], â??A summary can be defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that contains a significant portion of the information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s)â??.Automatic Text Summarization
Due to the growth of internet, the amount of information available at oneâ??s expense has increased, which in turn, has increased the problem of information overload.The software completely automates the process of creating presentations by choosing the topic for each slide on its own.The objective of the system proposed, is to develop software that accepts multiple documents as input to provide a concise and to-the-point presentation (as well as a summary) that conveys the content in the source documents in a presentable manner.Also, the current system creates only the summary of the document but does not provides anything in creating the presentation.Objective
Today, the current system of text summarization technique is a complex issue that uses the concept of data mining.It requires a huge amount of information to be extracted and analyzed which can sometimes be tedious and tiring.However, creating a good presentation is a time consuming process.The corporate and educational institutes use presentations extensively as a tool to convey their knowledge.It is typically a demonstration, lecture, or speech meant to inform or persuade the listeners.The output is in the form of a presentation containing the gist of the topic under consideration.The software takes the documents containing information from the user as the input for summarization.
SENTENCE ORDERING BASED ON CLUSTERING
In this process, sentences are ordered in a chronological manner.Higher the score of a sentence more is the importance of the sentence.This process is repeated for each cluster and summary is generated depending on the rank of the sentence.In sentence ordering, sentences are selected on the basis of their chorological order irrespective of their scores.If we had a two or three-dimensional space this measure is the actual geometric distance between objects in the space.SCORE GENERATION BASED ON FEATURE PROFILE
In this step, the documents in a particular cluster are split into sentences.A two-dimensional array with rows representing sentences and column representing words is created.Elimination of stop words:
A stop word can be a word without meaning in a specific language or it can be token that does not have any linguistic meaning.[5]

DOCUMENT REPRESENTATION
After preprocessing, we obtain a collection of words from the set of documents.The documents can be of any file format, including docx, pdf, html etc.  These files have to be first converted to text files.ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
Initially, the user has to provide the system with input documents.For this purpose, Java provides various facilities for reading, writing and creating files.Digits, hyphens, punctuation marks and case of the letters are the primary concern of this step.It is like giving brief information over the entire subject.Summarization of the text deals with knowing the basic idea of the entire topic.OBJECTIVES
To automate the process of creating presentations
Increased accuracy in summarization of text
Multipurpose features of text summarization and presentation creation
To ease the work of people who deal with presentations and summaries on a day to day basis.Our system deals with both these concepts thus providing an easy way for gathering and delivering information.Makes use of internet as per userâ??s requirement.FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES
Easy to use.Thus, a new system is proposed in which the software accepts multiple documents as input in order to provide a summary and from that summary a concise and to-the-point presentation is created (that conveys the content in the source documents in a presentable manner).The software completely automates the process of creating presentations by choosing the topic for each slide on its own.Presentation creation: It is the final stage in which the summarized text is subjected to creation of presentation.During this process, the user is also provided with a facility to insert an image(s) in the slide by simply browsing in the directories or selecting from a range of pictures that the software retrieves from Google.Sentence ordering on the basis of clustering: Based on the ranking of sentences based on feature profile, sentences are selected and ordered.PROBLEM STATEMENT
A presentation plays an important role when it comes to represent an idea or to explain the topic to the audience.Score generation based on feature profile: Based on feature profile salient sentences from each cluster are identified and ranked according to their weights of importance.Depending on the userâ??s choice, the system provides output in the form of a concise summary or a presentation covering the important points of the subject.However, it also allows the user to personalize the presentation in case the user wants to.All the relevant documents are grouped together into clusters by using threshold-based document clustering approach.Also, the current system creates only the summary of the document but does not provides anything in creating the presentation.The objective of the system proposed, is to develop software that accepts multiple documents as input to provide a concise and to-the-point presentation (as well as a summary) that conveys the content in the source documents in a presentable manner.Numerical data: Sentences having numerical data are usually necessary to be included in the summary.OBJECTIVE
Today, the current system of text summarization technique is a complex issue that uses the concept of data mining.Thus creating a summary is not an easy task.The term weight corresponds to the importance of the term in context with the subject under consideration.Sentence Position: According to this feature, the opening and closing sentences usually contain the gist of the topic and hence are given more importance.Having a higher score in the feature denotes higher importance of the sentence.Higher the score of title feature, higher is the ranking of the sentence [3].Sentence length: It is used to identify normalized length of sentences in a source.Shorter sentences are not expected to be a part of the summary.Term weight: It depicts the number of occurrences of a term in a document.A brief overview of the above features is as follows:
Title feature: It represents the number of words in a sentence that match with the words in the title.They include title feature, sentence length, term weight, sentence position, proper noun, and numerical data.As a result various clusters are formed.FEATURE SPECIFIC SUMMARIZATION
Feature based text summarization is used for ordering sentences in a cluster by analyzing the features of each sentence.Further these clusters are required for mining the data and creating a summarized text from a document.Once themes have been known, a representative passage in each theme is selected and included in the summary.Thus it leads to increase in inter cluster distances and minimizes the intra cluster distances.It can be defined as â??Finding groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups [1].â?? Due to this feature, clustering plays an important role in data mining concept and to extract the important and summarized information from a huge amount of data.Extractive methods work by selecting a subset of existing words, phrases, or sentences in the original text to form the summary.Summaries should preserve the essence of the subject of its source(s).A summary should typically be short, precise and to the point.A text is entered into the computer and a summarized text is returned, which is a non redundant extract from the original text.According to [1], â??A summary can be defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that contains a significant portion of the information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s)â??.AUTOMATIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION
Due to the growth of internet, the amount of information available at oneâ??s expense has increased, which in turn, has increased the problem of information overload.To address this problem, we have proposed to create software that automates the process of creating presentation with the help of data mining concepts.However, creating a good presentation is a time consuming process.The corporate and educational institutes use presentations extensively as a tool to convey their knowledge.It is typically a demonstration, lecture, or speech meant to inform or persuade the listeners.The output is in the form of a presentation containing the gist of the topic under consideration.The software takes the documents containing information from the user as the input for summarization.There is abundance of data available on the internet.
