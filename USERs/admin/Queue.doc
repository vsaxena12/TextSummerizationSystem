Common implementations are circular buffers and linked lists.In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer.A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.Often a peek or front operation is also entered, returning the value of the front element without dequeuing it.This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
